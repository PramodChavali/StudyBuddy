# StudyBuddy

Addicted to video games? Study Buddy will force you to study so you dont become a dissapointment to your parents!

Using Tkinter, the program opens a window that completely overiddes whatever unproductive tasks you were doing before!

This window can't be minimized or even closed with Alt + F4.

The questions are randomly generated using Google Gemini based on the user's setup.

## Setup

The user goes through this set up each time the program boots.

The setup opens a smaller Tkinter window to ask about what the user wants to study. Anything in the Ontario high school curriculum is supported. If the user gets a question wrong, a new question is generated, but if they get it right, the window dissapears and they can continue with whatever they were doing before until the next question is given.

Let's pretend I'm a grade 9 student who needs to study circles for math. The first question asks for the grade the user is in.

Then I'm asked how often the program should override what I am doing.

The next question asks what the user wants to study.

![Q3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8010975d-7523-4088-a953-fe014a2dffc8)

Finally, I am asked for additional information about what I want to study, specifically the unit of the subject I would like to review.

![Q4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8101668d-7217-48d2-bf4e-755c5bae11a2)

And sure enough, after 1 minute, my screen gets overridden with a grade 9 level math question about circles!
